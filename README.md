The Ames Housing data set (AmesHousing.csv) was created by Dean De Cock and was shared publicly for use in statistics and data analysis education. See here for the original description of the publication of this data: http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf

I retrieved the data set from: https://www.kaggle.com/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset
